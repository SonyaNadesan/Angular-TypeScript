# AngularApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.7.

I first worked with Angular when I joined Jefferies in Jly 2021, where I took up my first ever Full Stack role. Despite having little experience in front-end development, I managed to hit-the-ground-running with Angular, TypeScript and libraries such as DevExteme (by DevExpress). As of today (September 2022), I am proud to have developed so many screens and reusable compoents, which has sped up the development process at Jefferies. I have worked on various projects including admin portal, allowing us to manage permissions, as well as the Projections screen (JefCast), used heavily by Treasury's Cash Management Team.

Not only have I created components that can be used on any project (such as the ones on this project), but also components that meet specific business needs; these have been developed in a way that allows us to reuse them across a specific application. A great example of this was the control panel for JefCast, which was reused in both Live Forecasting and Daily Forecasting screens.

This project was set up to explore Angular and develop reusable components/services/helpers/models for Angular and TypeScript including:

- Pagination Component
- Checkboxes Component
- Radio Buttons Component
- Drop-Downs Component
- Basic Grids Component
- Expand/Collapse Panel Component
- Date Range Fields Component (with validation)
- Date Models, Helpers and Date Range Rule Factory
- Global Search Feature for DxDataGrid
- DxPivotGridBuilder & DxPivotGridFieldBuilder
- Arrow Key Navigation for table structures including the DxPivotGrid
- Multiple Cell/Column/Row Selection & Copy (selection on CNTRL, copy on CNTRL+C)
- Creating/Loading/Deleting/ Grid States & Filter Sets (GridConfigurationPanel, GridFilterSetFeatures/GridGriStateFeatures)
- Setting Grid States as Default(GridGriStateFeatures)
- Copy Link to Grid States/Filter Sets (GridFilterSetFeatures/GridGriStateFeatures)
- Allow users to switch grid layout of any instance of IGrid (DxPivotGrid/DxDataGrid) and show/hide column names (PivotGridSimpleConfigurations)
- Cookie Helper
- Array Helper

...and many more!
